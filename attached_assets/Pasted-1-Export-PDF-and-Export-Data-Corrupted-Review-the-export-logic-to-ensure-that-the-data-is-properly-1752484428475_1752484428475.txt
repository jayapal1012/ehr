1. Export PDF and Export Data Corrupted
Review the export logic to ensure that the data is properly encoded and structured before generating the file.


Make sure special characters, null values, or incomplete records are handled before export.


For PDF export, ensure that formatting libraries render the content as expected without layout breaks.


For CSV, check for consistent delimiters and escape sequences.


2. Link Health History with Patient Data
Ensure that every health-related update for a patient (manual edit or auto-update) is linked with their profile in a separate health history log.


Each entry should include a timestamp and the nature of the data change.


This history should be used to generate graphs in the patient view.


Ensure that health history is included as a data source for machine learning model predictions.


3. Patient Edit Button Not Working in Admin and Staff Panels
Ensure that the edit button triggers the correct action and the corresponding form is rendered.


Check that the patient record is fetched, displayed, and editable.


Ensure that the edited data updates the patient record and appends the new entry into the health history with date and time.


The change should be reflected in both the database and the graphs.


4. Disable Import Data Option
Hide or disable the import button or option in both frontend and backend.


Remove or comment out any unused or broken import-related logic to avoid confusion or potential security issues.


5. Fix the Exported CSV
Sanitize all fields before export to remove characters that break the CSV format.


Ensure that newlines, commas, and quotes are properly escaped or enclosed in quotes.


Maintain UTF-8 encoding to support multilingual data if necessary.


6. User Management Enhancements
In the admin panel, when a new patient is created, automatically set the login username as the patient's ID.


Set the default password as a combination of the patientâ€™s name and ID.


Add an option in both patient and doctor views to allow them to change their password.


Ensure the password update process is secure and only accessible to the authenticated user.


7. Patient Appointment Creation and Management
In the patient view, allow patients to create appointments by selecting date, time, staff name, and entering a brief description of the disease.


Ensure that appointments created by patients are visible to the respective staff member in their panel.


All appointments, regardless of patient or staff, should be visible to the admin in their panel.


8. AI Tools Integration
For health analysis, use a random forest model to process patient history and predict possible health risks.


For image analysis, use a ResNet-50 model with demo weights for testing. Only allow staff or admin to upload medical images.


Integrate prediction results in the respective views where relevant.


9. Add Logout Functionality
Ensure a logout button is present in the patient view for session termination.


On logout, clear session data and redirect to the login page or homepage.


10. Health History Graphs
Visualize health history data in the patient view using graphs that show progression over time.


Update the graphs automatically whenever new data is added or existing data is edited.


Ensure date and time are displayed accurately for each health record.
